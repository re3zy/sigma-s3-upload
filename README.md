README: Deploying the S3 File Upload React App
This README will guide you through setting up and deploying the React app and backend server for uploading files to an AWS S3 bucket. Follow these steps carefully to configure the environment and get the app running.

Prerequisites
Git: Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository.
Node.js: Install Node.js (v14 or higher recommended) to run the backend and React frontend.
AWS Account: An active AWS account to set up an S3 bucket and generate credentials.
Basic Knowledge: Familiarity with terminal commands and a text editor.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd <REPO_DIRECTORY>
Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
You need to create a .env file in the root directory of the backend (server.js) to securely store AWS credentials and S3 configurations.

Create a file named .env in the backend folder.
Add the following variables to the .env file:
makefile
Copy code
AWS_REGION=your-aws-region       # e.g., us-west-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
Replace your-aws-region, your-access-key-id, your-secret-access-key, and your-bucket-name with your actual AWS S3 details.
Step 3: Set Up AWS S3
Log in to the AWS Management Console:

Navigate to the S3 Dashboard.
Create a Bucket:

Click "Create bucket."
Choose a unique bucket name (e.g., my-upload-bucket).
Select the appropriate region (e.g., us-west-1).
Enable or disable public access as needed for your use case.
Configure CORS:

Go to your S3 bucket settings > Permissions > CORS Configuration.
Add the following CORS policy:
json
Copy code
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["POST", "GET"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
Set Permissions:

Ensure the IAM role/user used for the app has the AmazonS3FullAccess policy (or a custom policy with upload and download permissions for your bucket).
Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install Backend Dependencies: Navigate to the backend folder and run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Install Frontend Dependencies: Navigate to the frontend folder and run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Step 5: Run the Backend Server
Navigate to the folder containing server.js.
Start the backend server:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Verify the server is running on http://localhost:5000.
Step 6: Run the Frontend React App
Navigate to the folder containing the React app (src folder where App.js resides).
Start the React development server:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
Step 7: Test the App
Click the "Upload File" button in the app.
Select a file from your computer.
Verify that the file uploads successfully and displays a temporary download URL.
Confirm that the file appears in your S3 bucket.
Common Issues and Troubleshooting
Missing .env Variables:

Ensure all required variables are present in the .env file and correctly configured.
Access Denied Errors:

Verify your S3 bucket permissions and ensure your IAM user has sufficient access.
CORS Errors:

Double-check the CORS configuration for your S3 bucket.
Server Not Running:

Ensure server.js is running on http://localhost:5000.
Project Structure
Frontend:

App.js: Main React component rendering the UploadFile component.
UploadFile.js: Core file upload logic and UI.
UploadFile.css: Styling for the React app.
Backend:

server.js: Node.js server to handle S3 pre-signed URL requests.
Environment Notes
Do not commit your .env file or AWS credentials to the repository.
Rotate AWS credentials regularly for security.
